Added GrabbySub - Grabbing Movie & TV show's subs from the terminal 

REQUIRES	* jq for JSON interpretation for data processing
REQUIRES 	* pup for HTML processing 


	- Dynamically create menus based on what's available
	- Let users pick resolution & encoding version
	- Let users pick which language to use, all 20+ of them 
	- Just a tit bit faster than actually going to subscene.com, but if you are like me, you hate that annoying interface :P
